# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to **Xila**

Xila is an open-source operating system aimed at embedded systems that provides a user-friendly interface with powerful features. It is designed to run on microcontrollers with limited resources while providing efficient and scalable performance. The project aims to provide a fully functional operating system that can perform tasks such as multitasking, memory management, input-output handling, and file system management in constrained environments.

With Xila, developers can build applications for all sorts of end-devices like robotics, smart home automation, wearables, and much more. Xila provides its users with a structured API, a high-level programming language, powerful tools, and clear documentation for ease of use and integration.

The key objective of the project is to make development faster by leveraging Xilaâ€™s modular architecture, expandable library of drivers and libraries, and well-documented codebase. By utilizing these tools, developers can rapidly prototype and deploy new products without worrying about lower-level details. started
